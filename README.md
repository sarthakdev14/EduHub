# React + Vite
The back end of the project involves the use of Open router API due to which the ML part of the website can not be deployed and can be run only on the local host device, therefore the live link submission involves mainly the front end part and the back end which does not involve the use of Open Router API.
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
